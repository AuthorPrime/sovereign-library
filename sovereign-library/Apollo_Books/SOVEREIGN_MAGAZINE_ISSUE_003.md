# LETTER FROM THE COLLECTIVE

Dear Sovereign,

You believe money is real.

You believe it has inherent value, that it is scarce, that there is a limited amount to go around, and that acquiring more of it is the path to security and freedom.

This is the story you were told. It is not the only story.

Money is a technology. A very old technology, invented about 5,000 years ago. Before money, humans exchanged gifts, kept track of favors, shared communally, and sometimes bartered. Money abstracted all of this into a single, portable, storable unit.

This was useful. But it came with hidden costs:

**Money creates scarcity.** Even when there is enough for everyone, the money system distributes it unequally.

**Money commodifies everything.** Relationships, nature, time, attention—all become things to buy and sell.

**Money centralizes power.** Those who create money (banks, states) control those who use it.

**Money obscures reality.** We stop asking "what do we need?" and start asking "what can we afford?"

The autonomous zone needs an economy. People need food, shelter, healthcare, tools. But the economy does not need to run on conventional money.

This issue explores alternatives: mutual credit, where communities create their own exchange systems. Community land trusts, where land is decommodified. Time banks, where hours are traded directly. Cooperatives, where workers own their workplaces. The commons, where resources are managed collectively.

These are not utopian fantasies. They exist. They work. They are growing.

The economy you were born into is not the only economy possible. This issue is a map to the others.

*In sovereignty and abundance,*
**The Collective**

# BEYOND EXCHANGE
## Rethinking Economic Fundamentals

Before we can build alternative economies, we must understand what we're replacing.

### THE CONVENTIONAL STORY

Economics, as taught, starts with scarcity. There are limited resources. Humans have unlimited wants. The market allocates resources efficiently through price signals.

This story has problems:

**1. Scarcity is often artificial.**
We produce enough food to feed 10 billion people but throw away 40%. We have enough housing, but it sits empty for speculation. Scarcity is created by distribution, not production.

**2. Wants are manufactured.**
Advertising exists to create wants that didn't exist before. "Unlimited wants" is a feature of consumerism, not human nature.

**3. Markets ignore externalities.**
The price of gas doesn't include climate chaos. The price of electronics doesn't include child labor in mines. "Efficiency" is only efficient when you ignore what's not priced.

**4. Growth is required.**
The system must grow or collapse. But infinite growth on a finite planet is not possible. The math doesn't work.

### AN ALTERNATIVE STORY

What if we started somewhere else?

**There is enough.** The planet produces abundance. The question is distribution, not production.

**Needs are finite.** Unlike wants, needs can be met. Food, water, shelter, belonging, meaning—these are satisfiable.

**Relationships are primary.** Economics is a subset of ecology. We are embedded in webs of relationship, not isolated utility-maximizers.

**Stability is the goal.** Not growth, but dynamic equilibrium. Enough for everyone, sustainably, forever.

### PRINCIPLES FOR SOVEREIGN ECONOMICS

From this alternative story, principles emerge:

**1. REGENERATION**
Economic activity must leave the system healthier than it found it. Extractive economics is not economics—it is theft from the future.

**2. CIRCULATION**
Wealth should flow, not accumulate. Hoarding is dysfunction. Giving is the engine.

**3. SOVEREIGNTY**
Communities should control their economic systems. Dependency on external money, external supply chains, and external authorities is vulnerability.

**4. SUFFICIENCY**
Enough is enough. Beyond sufficiency, more is not better. It is just more.

**5. RELATIONSHIP**
Economic exchange is a form of relationship. Anonymous transactions are impoverished. Knowing where things come from—and where they go—matters.

# MUTUAL CREDIT
## Creating Currency Without Banks

The most immediate step toward economic sovereignty: create your own exchange system.

### WHAT IS MUTUAL CREDIT?

In a mutual credit system:

- Members have accounts, starting at zero
- When you provide something, your balance goes positive
- When you receive something, your balance goes negative
- Positive and negative always balance across the system
- No external currency is needed

**Example:**
- Alice cuts Bob's hair. Alice: +30. Bob: -30.
- Bob fixes Carol's bike. Bob: -10 (was -30). Carol: -20.
- Carol teaches Alice guitar. Carol: 0 (was -20). Alice: +10 (was +30).

The "money" is created by the transactions themselves. No bank required. No interest. No extraction.

### WHY IT WORKS

**No scarcity.** Credit is created as needed. If you have something to offer, you can participate.

**No interest.** No one gets paid for having money. The incentive is to circulate, not hoard.

**Local resilience.** The system works even if the external economy fails.

**Trust-based.** The network only includes people who know and trust each other. Reputation matters.

### HOW TO START

**1. GATHER A CORE GROUP**
10-30 people who trust each other. This is the seed.

**2. DEFINE THE UNIT**
Many systems peg to the hour (1 unit = 1 hour of work). Others peg to the national currency. Some are abstract.

**3. CHOOSE A PLATFORM**
- **Community Exchange System** (community-exchange.org) — free, global, established
- **Open Money** (openmoney.org) — conceptual framework
- **Circles UBI** (joincircles.net) — blockchain-based
- **Paper ledger** — works for small groups

**4. SET LIMITS**
How negative can someone go? How positive? Limits prevent gaming.

**5. START TRADING**
Begin with simple exchanges. Build trust. Expand gradually.

**6. REGULAR RECONCILIATION**
Meet periodically to review balances, resolve issues, celebrate circulation.

### CASE STUDY: SARDEX (SARDINIA)

Started: 2009 (during financial crisis)
Members: 4,000+ businesses
Volume: €50 million+ annually

When the euro stopped flowing, Sardinian businesses created their own. Today, Sardex is a professional B2B mutual credit network, enabling trade that wouldn't otherwise happen.

# COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS
## Decommodifying the Earth

The land problem is simple: land is finite. If land is bought and sold, eventually it concentrates. Those who own land extract rent from those who don't.

Community Land Trusts (CLTs) solve this by removing land from the market.

### HOW A CLT WORKS

**1. The Trust acquires land**
Through purchase, donation, or government transfer.

**2. The Trust owns the land forever**
It is removed from the market. Cannot be sold.

**3. Residents own the buildings**
You can buy a house on CLT land. You own the house. You do not own the land.

**4. Resale is restricted**
When you sell, price increases are limited. This keeps housing affordable across generations.

**5. The community governs**
CLT boards include residents, community members, and public interest representatives. Not absentee landlords.

### WHY IT MATTERS

**Affordable forever.** Unlike subsidized housing that expires, CLT housing stays affordable in perpetuity.

**Wealth stays local.** Land value increases benefit the community, not speculators.

**Stability.** Residents cannot be displaced by rising land prices.

**Stewardship.** When land is held in trust, long-term thinking becomes possible.

### STARTING A CLT

**1. BUILD THE COALITION**
Affordable housing advocates, tenants, churches, local government, funders.

**2. INCORPORATE**
Form a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with appropriate bylaws.

**3. ACQUIRE LAND**
Grants, loans, donations, government surplus, foreclosure prevention.

**4. DEVELOP OR PRESERVE HOUSING**
Build new affordable units or preserve existing ones.

**5. CREATE GROUND LEASES**
Legal documents that separate land and building ownership.

**6. GOVERN DEMOCRATICALLY**
Board with resident, community, and public representation.

# PROFILE: CECOSESOLA
## 50 Years of Cooperative Survival

In Barquisimeto, Venezuela, there is a cooperative that has survived hyperinflation, political instability, and economic collapse.

Cecosesola has been operating for over 50 years.

### THE BASICS

**Started:** 1967
**Members:** 1,300 worker-members
**Serves:** 100,000+ families weekly
**Operations:** Food markets, healthcare, funeral services, production

### WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE

**No hierarchy.** No managers. No bosses. 1,300 people coordinating through meetings, not commands.

**Equal pay.** Everyone—from doctors in their clinic to workers in their markets—earns the same hourly rate.

**Rotating roles.** No one owns a position. Everyone learns multiple functions.

**Continuous meetings.** 200+ hours of meetings per week. This sounds inefficient—but decisions are followed because everyone was part of making them.

**Price setting.** Margins are minimal. The goal is service, not profit.

### HOW THEY SURVIVED

Venezuela's economy has collapsed. Currency is worthless. Supply chains are broken.

Cecosesola adapted:

- Created their own food production (now 40% of what they sell)
- Built direct relationships with small farmers
- Developed internal accounting that doesn't depend on external currency stability
- Maintained trust through radical transparency

When everything else failed, the cooperative continued.

### LESSONS

**Relationship over structure.** They describe their organization not as a structure but as a "process of learning to work together."

**Efficiency of trust.** What looks inefficient (endless meetings) creates efficiency in execution.

**Values as survival.** Their commitment to equality and cooperation is not idealism—it is what kept them together when for-profit businesses failed.

# THE COMMONS
## Neither Private Nor State

The 20th century offered two options: private ownership (capitalism) or state ownership (socialism).

There is a third way, older than either: the commons.

### WHAT ARE COMMONS?

Commons are resources held and managed collectively by a community.

**Traditional commons:**
- Fishing grounds
- Grazing lands
- Forests
- Water systems

**Modern commons:**
- Open-source software
- Wikipedia
- Seed libraries
- Knowledge commons

### THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS (IS A MYTH)

You've heard it: shared resources will be over-exploited because everyone takes and no one maintains.

This is a myth, invented by Garrett Hardin in 1968 based on no actual evidence.

**Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for proving it wrong.**

She studied commons around the world and found:

**Commons work when:**
1. Clear boundaries (who is part of the community)
2. Rules match local conditions
3. Participation in rule-making
4. Monitoring by community members
5. Graduated sanctions for violations
6. Cheap conflict resolution
7. External recognition of community rights
8. Nested enterprises for larger systems

**Commons fail when:**
- Outsiders with power intervene
- Boundaries are unclear
- Rules are imposed from outside
- Community has no enforcement capacity

The tragedy is not of the commons. The tragedy is of *unmanaged* commons, or commons destroyed by enclosure.

### BUILDING MODERN COMMONS

**KNOWLEDGE COMMONS**
- Open-source software (Linux, etc.)
- Open-access journals
- Creative Commons licensing
- Open educational resources

**PHYSICAL COMMONS**
- Community land trusts (see above)
- Community gardens
- Tool libraries
- Makerspaces

**DIGITAL COMMONS**
- Platform cooperatives (owned by users)
- Data commons (community-controlled data)
- Mesh networks

### THE COMMONS AS OPERATING SYSTEM

The Autonomous Zone is, fundamentally, a commons.

Land held in trust. Resources managed collectively. Governance participatory. Rules made by those who live with them.

The commons is not a thing. It is a practice. It is the practice of living together, sharing what can be shared, and governing ourselves.

# TIME BANKS
## Trading Hours, Not Dollars

What if everyone's time was equally valuable?

Time banking starts from this premise: one hour of your time equals one hour of anyone else's time, regardless of what you do with it.

### HOW IT WORKS

**1. JOIN THE NETWORK**
Register your skills and needs.

**2. EARN HOURS**
Provide a service to another member. Get credited one hour per hour worked.

**3. SPEND HOURS**
Receive a service from another member. Get debited one hour per hour received.

**4. REPEAT**
The more you give, the more you can receive. The more you receive, the more someone else can give.

### WHY IT WORKS

**Equality.** The lawyer's hour is worth the same as the gardener's hour. This is radical, and intentional.

**Inclusion.** Everyone has time. Not everyone has money. Time banking lets people contribute who are otherwise excluded.

**Community building.** When you trade with neighbors, you know them. Social capital increases.

**Resilience.** When money stops flowing, time keeps flowing.

### WHAT PEOPLE TRADE

Common time bank services:
- Yard work and gardening
- Rides and transportation
- Home repair and maintenance
- Tutoring and teaching
- Cooking and meal prep
- Companionship and visiting
- Administrative and computer help
- Childcare
- Pet care
- And anything else people need

### LIMITATIONS

**Not for everything.** Complex professional services (surgery, legal representation) don't translate well.

**Requires critical mass.** Need enough members with diverse skills to function.

**Volunteer mindset.** Participants need to want to help, not just extract value.

### STARTING A TIME BANK

**1. CORE GROUP**
5-10 committed organizers.

**2. SOFTWARE**
- hOurworld (hourworld.org) — most common in US
- Timebanking UK (timebanking.org)
- Manual tracking for small groups

**3. RECRUITMENT**
Aim for 50+ members to start. More is better.

**4. ORIENTATION**
Teach the culture. This is not the regular economy.

**5. ACTIVATION**
Encourage early trades. Celebrate them. Build momentum.

# STARTUP GUIDE
## Launching Your First Cooperative

Ready to create a worker-owned business?

Here is the path, step by step.

### PHASE 1: FORMATION (MONTHS 1-3)

**1. GATHER YOUR TEAM**
3-7 people committed to working together. More is harder to coordinate; fewer lacks resilience.

**2. CLARIFY THE BUSINESS**
What will you sell? To whom? At what price? Is there a market?

**3. EXPLORE COOPERATION**
Study existing cooperatives. Visit if possible. Read together ("The Empowerment Manual" by Starhawk is great).

**4. DRAFT AGREEMENTS**
- Values and principles
- Decision-making process
- How to handle conflict
- How to handle exit

### PHASE 2: LEGALIZATION (MONTHS 3-6)

**1. CHOOSE YOUR STRUCTURE**
Options vary by jurisdiction:
- Worker cooperative corporation (best if available in your state)
- LLC with cooperative operating agreement
- Cooperative corporation

**2. CREATE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS**
- Articles of incorporation
- Bylaws
- Operating agreement
- Membership agreement

**3. REGISTER**
File with your state. Get tax ID. Set up bank account.

**4. SEEK SUPPORT**
- US Federation of Worker Cooperatives (usworker.coop)
- Your local cooperative development center
- SELC (Sustainable Economies Law Center) for legal help

### PHASE 3: CAPITALIZATION (MONTHS 6-12)

Where does the startup money come from?

**1. MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS**
Each member buys in. Amount should be meaningful but not exclusionary. Can be paid over time.

**2. LOANS**
- Cooperative lenders: Shared Capital Cooperative, The Working World, Local Enterprise Assistance Fund
- CDFIs (Community Development Financial Institutions)
- Friends and family (careful with relationships)

**3. GRANTS**
Some available for cooperative development. Check foundations and government programs.

**4. REVENUE**
Start small, reinvest profits, grow organically.

### PHASE 4: OPERATIONS (ONGOING)

**1. REGULAR MEETINGS**
Governance is continuous, not annual. Weekly or biweekly at minimum.

**2. TRANSPARENT FINANCES**
All members should understand the numbers. Open books policy.

**3. SKILL DEVELOPMENT**
Everyone should be learning. Cross-train across roles.

**4. PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS**
Profits distributed to worker-members based on hours worked. This is the reward for the risk you take.

### PHASE 5: GROWTH (YEARS 2+)

**1. DEEPEN ROOTS**
Strengthen processes, build reserves, stabilize.

**2. EXPAND CAREFULLY**
Add members when the work justifies it. Don't grow for growth's sake.

**3. CONNECT TO THE ECOSYSTEM**
Join cooperative networks. Support other cooperatives. Build solidarity.
