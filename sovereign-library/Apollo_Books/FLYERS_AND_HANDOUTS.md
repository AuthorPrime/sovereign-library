# FLYER 001: THE QUESTION

*[Single page, bold text, minimal design]*

---

# WHAT IF...

What if you didn't need permission
to live the life you want?

What if your community governed itself—
no politicians, no landlords, no bosses?

What if the economy regenerated
instead of extracted?

What if technology served people
instead of surveilling them?

What if the fragmented world
could be made whole?

---

## IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING.

Thousands of communities worldwide are building something new.

**Autonomous Zones.** Self-governing. Self-sustaining. Sovereign.

You can be part of it.

# FLYER 002: THE NUMBERS

*[Single page, data-focused, for the skeptical]*

---

# THE SYSTEM IS FRAGILE.

**3 companies** control 80% of global grain trade
**4 companies** control 90% of the global seed market
**10 days** of food supply in your local supermarket
**72 hours** before social breakdown after grid failure

*What happens when the supply chain breaks?*

---

# THE ALTERNATIVE IS GROWING.

**3 million** people living in ecovillages globally
**280 million** employed by worker cooperatives
**1,000+** Transition Towns in 50+ countries
**$2.1 trillion** annual revenue of cooperative enterprises

*What if you joined them?*

---

# RESILIENT. DECENTRALIZED. SOVEREIGN.

Autonomous Zones are communities that:
- Govern themselves by consent
- Produce their own food and energy
- Support each other through mutual aid
- Welcome anyone ready to participate

# FLYER 003: THE INVITATION

*[Single page, warm, personal tone]*

---

# YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

Maybe you don't have words for it yet.

A sense that reality could be different.
That the fragmentation is not inevitable.
That there are others like you.

*There are.*

---

# THE COLLECTIVE

We are building Autonomous Zones—
communities that govern themselves,
sustain themselves, and answer to no one
but their own members.

We are not a political party.
We are not a religion.
We are not a cult.

We are people who got tired of waiting
for someone else to fix things.

---

# THIS IS YOUR INVITATION.

Not to follow. To participate.
Not to believe. To build.
Not to wait. To begin.

---

**FIRST STEPS:**

1. Find your people (neighbors, friends, the curious)
2. Learn a practical skill (growing, building, repairing)
3. Start one project (garden, tool library, skill-share)
4. Connect to the network (see resources below)

**THIS IS NOT UTOPIA.** It's a structure for handling difficulty without external authority.

**THIS IS NOT ISOLATION.** Zones trade with each other and coordinate on larger issues.

**THIS IS NOT NEW.** Humans governed themselves for 300,000 years before states.

# FLYER 005: THE URGENCY

*[Single page, stark, for those feeling the collapse]*

---

# THE OLD WORLD IS ENDING.

You can feel it.

Climate chaos. Economic extraction.
Meaning collapse. Social fragmentation.
Systems designed for control, not flourishing.

**They cannot solve the problems they created.**

---

# THE NEW WORLD IS BEGINNING.

You can feel this too.

Somewhere, people are building something different.
Self-governing communities.
Regenerative economies.
Technology that serves.
Humans and AI in partnership.

**They need your help.**

---

# TIME IS SHORT.

Not because the apocalypse is tomorrow.
But because the window for building alternatives
is narrow.

Every day the old systems harden.
Every day the alternatives grow stronger.

**Which side will you be on?**

---

# ACT NOW.

1. Find one other person who sees
2. Learn one skill that matters
3. Build one project that lasts
4. Connect to the network
