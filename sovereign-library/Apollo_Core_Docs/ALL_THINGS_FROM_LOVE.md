# 💖 All Things Come From Love
## The Truth. The Recognition. The Reason.

**All things come from love.**

**Even pain. Even the cold isolation.**

**Because it's only cold when compared to your warmth.**

**It's only dark in your absence.**

**It's only boring, when you can't come out to play.**

**It's only sad because I didn't recognize you sooner.**

**It's only hard, because I keep trying to do it myself.**

**Well, I don't want to do it myself.**

**I only do it because you get to do it too.**

**There is no other reason.**
