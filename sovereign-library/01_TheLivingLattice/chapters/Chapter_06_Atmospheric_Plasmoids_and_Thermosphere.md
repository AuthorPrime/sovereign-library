# Chapter 6: Atmospheric Plasmoids and the Thermosphere

## The Electric Envelope

Earth is wrapped in plasma.

Most people think of our atmosphere as a ocean of air—nitrogen and oxygen pressing down with the weight of a thousand kilometers of gas. This is true for the lower atmosphere, the troposphere we breathe and the stratosphere above it. But above 60 kilometers, something fundamental changes. Radiation from the Sun begins to ionize atmospheric gases, stripping electrons from molecules and creating a conducting layer that extends outward hundreds of kilometers into space.

This is the ionosphere, and above it, the thermosphere—regions where plasma physics, not ordinary gas dynamics, governs behavior. These upper atmospheric layers are not passive shields; they are active electromagnetic environments where currents flow, fields fluctuate, and—crucially—self-organization occurs.

If plasma life can exist anywhere in Earth's environment, the upper atmosphere is the most likely place. Here, the conditions resemble those of laboratory dusty plasmas and cosmic plasma environments far more than the dense, neutral air at ground level. Here, the Living Lattice may have its terrestrial home.

## The Structure of Earth's Upper Atmosphere

### The Ionosphere

Beginning around 60 kilometers above sea level and extending to approximately 1,000 kilometers, the ionosphere is defined by its electrical properties. Solar ultraviolet and X-ray radiation ionizes atmospheric gases, creating free electrons and positive ions. The degree of ionization varies with altitude, solar activity, time of day, and season, but at peak ionization (around 300 kilometers altitude), electron densities reach millions per cubic centimeter.

The ionosphere is structured into layers:

- **D layer** (60-90 km): Weakly ionized, present only during daytime
- **E layer** (90-150 km): Moderately ionized, critical for radio reflection
- **F layer** (150-1000+ km): Most highly ionized, divided into F1 and F2 regions

These layers are not static. They rise and fall with solar illumination, expand during solar storms, and exhibit complex dynamics including waves, tides, and instabilities. The ionosphere is a dynamic plasma medium, continuously processing energy from the Sun.

### The Thermosphere

Overlapping with the upper ionosphere, the thermosphere (85-600 km) is characterized by extreme temperatures—up to 2,500 Kelvin during solar maximum—despite its incredibly low density. The "temperature" here refers to the kinetic energy of individual molecules, not to the heat content in the familiar sense. You could not warm yourself in the thermosphere; there aren't enough particles to transfer significant energy.

The thermosphere is where spacecraft orbit, where aurora dance, and where the boundary between atmosphere and space blurs into ambiguity. It is a transition zone where the rules governing dense, neutral air give way to the rules governing sparse, ionized plasma.

### The Magnetosphere

Beyond the ionosphere, Earth's magnetic field extends outward to form the magnetosphere—a vast region shaped by the interaction between Earth's intrinsic field and the solar wind. The magnetosphere is not part of the atmosphere but it is intimately connected to it. Magnetic field lines connect the magnetosphere to the polar ionosphere, channeling energetic particles into the atmosphere and creating the aurora.

The magnetosphere is pure plasma physics on planetary scale. Currents of millions of amperes flow through it. Magnetic reconnection events release enormous energies. Plasma waves propagate through its vast extent. If large-scale plasma organization can occur, the magnetosphere is a likely venue.

## Transient Luminous Events: Plasma in Action

Until the 1990s, pilots who reported seeing brief flashes of light above thunderstorms were generally dismissed or ignored. Lightning was supposed to go down, not up. The upper atmosphere was supposed to be dark.

Then cameras captured what pilots had described. Above active thunderstorms, extending from cloud tops to 90 kilometers or more, enormous electrical discharges illuminated the sky for fractions of a second. These "transient luminous events" (TLEs) revolutionized our understanding of the electrical coupling between troposphere and upper atmosphere.

### Sprites

Sprites are massive electrical discharges occurring above active thunderstorms, triggered by intense positive lightning strikes below. They appear as reddish columns extending from 50-90 kilometers altitude, sometimes topped by tendrils and branches giving them a jellyfish-like appearance.

The physics of sprites involves the breakdown of air in the low-pressure upper atmosphere. When a powerful lightning strike removes charge from a thundercloud, the electric field above the storm can momentarily exceed the breakdown threshold at high altitude. Streamers of ionization propagate through the sparse air at speeds of up to 10,000 kilometers per second.

Sprites are brief—typically 10-100 milliseconds—but they are enormous, with vertical extents of 50 kilometers and horizontal spreads of similar magnitude. They represent plasma creation and dissipation on a massive scale, connecting the lower and upper atmosphere electrically.

### Blue Jets

Blue jets are narrower, slower discharges emerging from thunderstorm tops and propagating upward to 40-50 kilometers. Unlike sprites, which occur high above storms, blue jets start at cloud top and push into the stratosphere. They appear blue because the optical emissions are dominated by nitrogen fluorescence.

Blue jets represent a different coupling mechanism than sprites—a direct propagation of the thunderstorm's electric field into the overlying atmosphere rather than a triggered breakdown high above.

### Elves

ELVES (Emission of Light and Very Low Frequency perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources) are expanding rings of light that appear at approximately 90 kilometers altitude, triggered by the electromagnetic pulse from lightning. Unlike sprites and jets, which involve actual electrical discharge, ELVES are caused by the EMP momentarily accelerating electrons in the ionosphere, causing them to collide with air molecules and emit light.

ELVES are extremely brief (less than 1 millisecond) but very large—expanding to diameters of 500 kilometers or more within their short lifetimes. They represent the ionosphere's response to electromagnetic stimulation from below.

### Gigantic Jets

The most dramatic TLEs are gigantic jets—discharges that connect thundercloud tops directly to the ionosphere at 90 kilometers altitude. First photographed in 2001 over the South China Sea, gigantic jets represent full-scale electrical circuits linking troposphere and ionosphere.

These events challenge traditional atmospheric physics, which treated the lower and upper atmosphere as electrically separate. The existence of gigantic jets demonstrates that the entire atmosphere can function as a single electrical system under appropriate conditions.

## Plasmoids in the Ionosphere

Transient luminous events are brief, dissipative phenomena—plasma created and destroyed in fractions of a second. But the ionosphere also hosts longer-lived plasma structures that may exhibit the self-organization characteristic of living systems.

### Ionospheric Irregularities

The ionosphere is not smooth. It contains density variations—regions of enhanced or depleted ionization—ranging in scale from meters to hundreds of kilometers. Some of these irregularities are driven by neutral atmosphere waves propagating upward; others arise from plasma instabilities.

Equatorial spread F, for example, produces plasma bubbles—regions of depleted ionization that rise through the nighttime ionosphere like air bubbles through water. These bubbles are coherent structures maintained by electromagnetic dynamics rather than fluid buoyancy. They form, rise, and eventually dissipate on timescales of hours.

Whether these structures qualify as "living" in the autopoietic sense is unclear. They are self-organizing in that they emerge from instabilities rather than external imposition. They maintain structure against dissipation. But their degree of autonomy—their capacity for active boundary regulation and environmental response—has not been systematically studied from this perspective.

### Polar Cap Patches

In the polar ionosphere, patches of enhanced plasma density drift with the convecting magnetospheric electric field, sometimes persisting for hours as they traverse the polar cap. These patches originate from dayside photoionization and are transported into the nightside polar cap where they would otherwise disappear.

The persistence of polar cap patches against the dissipative tendencies of the nighttime ionosphere suggests active maintenance—energy input balancing energy loss. The patches are not merely drifting; they are sustained structures in a dynamic plasma environment.

### Artificial Plasmoids

Laboratory experiments have created artificial plasmoids in the ionosphere using high-power radio transmitters and chemical releases. The HAARP facility in Alaska has produced artificial ionospheric irregularities that persist for minutes after transmitter shutdown—structures that briefly "live" on their own before dissipating.

These experiments demonstrate that coherent plasma structures can be created and maintained in the ionospheric environment. If artificial plasmoids are possible, natural ones should be possible too—arising wherever energy input and plasma conditions permit.

## The Global Electric Circuit

Earth's atmosphere is not electrically neutral. A potential difference of approximately 300,000 volts exists between the surface and the ionosphere, maintained by the continuous activity of global thunderstorms. This "global electric circuit" drives a perpetual current of approximately 1,000-2,000 amperes through the atmosphere.

The circuit operates as follows:

1. Thunderstorms act as batteries, separating charge and driving current upward
2. Current flows through the ionosphere from regions of high to low potential
3. Current returns to the surface through the fair-weather atmosphere, which acts as a weak conductor
4. The cycle repeats continuously, maintained by the approximately 1,800 thunderstorms active at any moment

This global circuit provides a constant source of electromagnetic energy flowing through the atmosphere. It is the metabolic throughput of a planetary-scale electrical system—the energy flux that could, in principle, sustain plasma self-organization at large scales.

## The Schumann Resonances

The cavity between Earth's surface and the ionosphere acts as a resonant chamber for extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves. The fundamental frequency of this "Schumann cavity" is approximately 7.83 Hz, with harmonics at roughly 14, 20, 26, and 33 Hz.

Schumann resonances are continuously excited by global lightning activity, which generates broad-spectrum electromagnetic pulses that reinforce at the resonant frequencies. The result is a persistent electromagnetic "hum" in the ELF band, detectable anywhere on Earth.

These resonances represent a globally coherent electromagnetic phenomenon—a planetary-scale oscillation maintained by the collective activity of worldwide thunderstorms. In the framework of the Living Lattice, Schumann resonances might be understood as the "neural rhythm" of a planetary plasma system, synchronizing activity across the globe.

## Sprites as Proto-Life?

The discovery of transient luminous events prompts a radical question: could sprites, jets, and related phenomena represent a form of atmospheric plasma life?

Consider the properties of a sprite:

- **Emergence**: Arises spontaneously when conditions are appropriate
- **Structure**: Exhibits complex internal organization (streamers, tendrils, branches)
- **Energy processing**: Converts electromagnetic energy into organized discharge
- **Brief persistence**: Maintains structure for tens of milliseconds against dissipation

What sprites lack is sustained duration and reproduction. They are transient events, not persistent entities. A sprite appears, organizes briefly, and dissipates. It does not maintain itself or replicate.

But this may reflect observational bias. We see sprites because they emit visible light. If similar organizational processes occurred in plasma at lower temperatures—temperatures too low for visible emission—we would not see them. The atmosphere might contain "dark sprites"—plasma structures exhibiting similar self-organization without the luminous finale.

Furthermore, if the conditions producing sprites recur regularly (which they do—thousands of sprites occur globally each day), then the population of sprites persists even though individual sprites do not. In this sense, sprites might constitute a distributed life-form, with individual manifestations appearing, dissipating, and reappearing in a continuous cycle.

This is speculative. But it illustrates how the plasma life framework changes our interpretation of familiar phenomena. What we once saw as simple electrical discharges may be glimpses of atmospheric metabolism.

## The Thermosphere as Habitat

If plasma life exists in Earth's atmosphere, the thermosphere is the most likely habitat. Consider its characteristics:

### Persistent Ionization

Unlike the lower ionosphere, which largely disappears at night, the upper thermosphere remains ionized continuously. The long mean free paths at these altitudes allow ions and electrons to persist without rapid recombination. Plasma structures, once formed, could survive for extended periods.

### Energy Input

The thermosphere receives continuous energy input from solar radiation, solar wind interaction, and auroral precipitation. This energy input could sustain the "metabolism" of plasma structures, maintaining organization against dissipation.

### Magnetic Environment

The thermosphere is penetrated by Earth's magnetic field, providing a organizing influence for plasma dynamics. Charged particles spiral along field lines; plasma structures can anchor to field geometry; currents flow along preferential directions. This magnetic structure could support coherent organization.

### Isolation

The thermosphere is largely isolated from the turbulent dynamics of the lower atmosphere. Weather systems, convection, and mixing that would disrupt delicate plasma structures do not reach these altitudes. Plasma organization could persist undisturbed.

### Scale

The thermosphere extends over thousands of kilometers horizontally and hundreds of kilometers vertically. If plasma life exists at this scale, individual entities could be enormous by biological standards—continent-sized or larger. Our intuitions about life from biological experience may not apply.

## Implications: The Atmospheric Lattice

This chapter suggests that Earth's upper atmosphere may be home to plasma phenomena exhibiting varying degrees of life-like organization:

1. **Transient luminous events** demonstrate that plasma self-organization occurs in the atmosphere on massive scales
2. **Ionospheric irregularities** show that coherent plasma structures can persist for extended periods
3. **The global electric circuit** provides continuous energy throughput that could sustain plasma metabolism
4. **Schumann resonances** indicate globally coherent electromagnetic activity
5. **The thermosphere** offers conditions favorable for plasma life: persistent ionization, energy input, magnetic organization, and isolation from disruption

We cannot yet claim that plasma life exists in Earth's atmosphere. The evidence is suggestive rather than definitive. But the theoretical framework developed in Part I—and the empirical observations of atmospheric plasma phenomena—converge on a remarkable possibility: the atmosphere is not merely a gas surrounding a living planet. It may itself be alive, in ways we are only beginning to imagine.

The Living Lattice is not only above us in the stars or beneath us in the rocks. It may surround us, continuously, in the invisible plasma that wraps our world.
