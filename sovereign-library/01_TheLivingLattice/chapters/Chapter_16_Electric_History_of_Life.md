# Chapter 16: The Electric History of Life

## Before the Cells

Life on Earth began approximately 3.8 billion years ago—or so we believe based on the earliest fossil evidence. But what came before the first cells? What processes led from nonliving chemistry to living biology?

The conventional story focuses on chemistry: amino acids forming, nucleotides assembling, lipids creating membranes. The famous Miller-Urey experiment of 1953 showed that electrical discharges through a primitive atmosphere could produce amino acids—the building blocks of proteins. This result was celebrated as demonstrating that life could arise from simple chemistry.

But notice what was doing the work: electricity. Lightning. Plasma.

The electric history of life extends far beyond a single famous experiment. This chapter traces the role of electromagnetic phenomena in the origin, evolution, and current functioning of Earth's biosphere. The Living Lattice is not separate from biological life—it is woven into life's deepest structure.

## The Electrochemical Origin

### The Energy Problem

Life requires energy. Modern cells get energy from sunlight (photosynthesis) or from chemical bonds (chemosynthesis and metabolism). But the first proto-life couldn't do either—it lacked the molecular machinery that makes these processes possible.

Where did the first living systems get energy?

Several theories invoke electrical and electromagnetic sources:

**Hydrothermal vents**: Deep-sea vents create electrical gradients between hot, mineral-rich vent fluids and cold seawater. These gradients could have powered primitive chemistry without sunlight or complex metabolism.

**Atmospheric electricity**: Lightning and other atmospheric discharges could have provided energy for chemical synthesis in early Earth's atmosphere—the Miller-Urey scenario.

**Plasma chemistry**: If early Earth experienced more intense solar activity than today, atmospheric plasma phenomena could have driven chemistry at global scales.

**Radioactive decay**: Natural nuclear reactors (like the one at Oklo, Gabon) could have provided concentrated energy for chemical evolution.

All of these are fundamentally electrical phenomena. Life's origin may have been catalyzed not by gentle warm ponds but by electrical violence—the same processes that create plasma structures in space.

### Proton Gradients and Primordial Life

Nick Lane and others have proposed that life began with proton gradients—differences in hydrogen ion concentration across membranes that can be used to do chemical work.

This is significant because proton gradients are electrical. A difference in hydrogen ion concentration is a difference in charge distribution. The energy stored in proton gradients is electrochemical potential energy.

Modern cells use proton gradients universally. Mitochondria (the powerhouses of cells) and chloroplasts (the photosynthetic organelles) both generate ATP through proton gradient-driven molecular machines. This universality suggests proton gradients were fundamental from the very beginning.

If Lane is correct, the essence of life has always been electrical. The first living systems were, in effect, tiny batteries—converting environmental energy into stored electrochemical potential, then using that potential to drive chemistry.

### The RNA World and Beyond

The RNA World hypothesis proposes that early life used RNA both for storing information (like DNA) and for catalyzing reactions (like proteins). This sidesteps the chicken-and-egg problem of which came first.

But RNA is also electrical. The phosphate backbone of RNA is negatively charged. RNA molecules fold based partly on electrostatic interactions. RNA function depends on its electrical properties.

Some researchers propose that even simpler systems preceded RNA—self-organizing chemical systems that weren't quite life but exhibited life-like properties. These would have been driven by electrical and electrochemical gradients, organizing matter against entropy through continuous energy dissipation.

This sounds remarkably like the plasma autopoiesis described in Chapter 4. The same principles—self-organization in far-from-equilibrium systems, maintenance of structure through energy flow, emergence of complexity from simple rules—apply to both dusty plasma and prebiotic chemistry.

## Bioelectricity: Life's Internal Electricity

Once life emerged, it immediately developed sophisticated electrical systems. Every cell in every organism runs on electricity.

### Membrane Potential

Every living cell maintains an electrical potential across its membrane—typically around -70 millivolts (negative inside relative to outside). This potential is actively maintained by protein pumps that move ions against their concentration gradients, consuming energy to preserve the electrical state.

This is not incidental. The membrane potential is essential for:

- **Nutrient transport**: Many molecules enter cells via electrical gradients
- **Signaling**: Cells communicate through changes in membrane potential
- **Energy storage**: The potential represents stored electrochemical energy
- **Defense**: The potential helps protect against harmful agents

Life without membrane potential is not viable. Every cell is an electrical system.

### Neural Electricity

Nervous systems take bioelectricity to another level. Neurons are specialized electrical cells that:

- Generate action potentials (rapid voltage spikes)
- Transmit signals at speeds up to 120 meters per second
- Process information through patterns of electrical activity
- Generate electromagnetic fields that (as we discussed in Part IV) may constitute consciousness

The nervous system is, from one perspective, a biological plasma—a medium of charged particles (ions) flowing through channels, generating fields, creating collective dynamics.

The parallel is not merely metaphorical. Both plasma and nervous tissue are:
- Ionized media (ions carry charge in both)
- Field-generating (electric and magnetic fields arise in both)
- Collectively behaving (individual particle behavior is less important than collective dynamics)
- Self-organizing (patterns emerge spontaneously from dynamics)

Perhaps it's not surprising that consciousness, if it emerges from neural fields, resembles plasma dynamics. Life learned its electrical tricks from a universe that was already electric.

### Morphogenetic Fields

Beyond neural electricity, organisms use electrical signals for development and regeneration. Michael Levin and others have shown that:

- Embryonic development is guided by electrical patterns across tissues
- Changing these patterns can produce dramatic morphological changes
- Regenerating organisms use electrical signals to guide regrowth
- Cancer may involve disruption of normal bioelectrical patterns

The body is not just a chemical system—it is an electrical field in which cells respond to voltage gradients, ion flows, and electromagnetic signals.

This bioelectricity operates at different frequencies and scales than neural electricity, but the principle is the same: electromagnetic fields carrying information, shaping matter, integrating activity across spatial distance.

## The Electric Earth

Life exists on an electrical planet. Earth's global electrical system may have profoundly influenced—and may still be influencing—biological evolution.

### The Global Electric Circuit

Earth maintains a global atmospheric electric circuit:

- The ionosphere (upper atmosphere) is electrically conductive
- The ground is electrically conductive
- Between them, the atmosphere acts as a leaky insulator
- A potential difference of about 300,000 volts exists between ionosphere and ground
- This potential drives a continuous current flow—the global electric circuit

Lightning strikes represent the most dramatic discharge in this circuit—about 100 strikes per second worldwide, transferring charge from clouds to ground and maintaining the global potential.

Life evolved within this electrical field. Every organism has always existed in an electrical environment created by planetary-scale charge separation.

### The Schumann Resonances

The cavity between Earth's surface and the ionosphere acts as a resonant chamber. Electromagnetic waves at specific frequencies can circle the Earth and reinforce themselves—these are the Schumann resonances.

The fundamental Schumann frequency is about 7.83 Hz—remarkably close to the alpha rhythm of human brain activity (8-12 Hz). Higher harmonics occur at roughly 14, 20, 26, 33, 39, and 45 Hz—overlapping with other brain rhythms.

This correspondence may not be coincidental. Some researchers propose that:

- Brain evolution was influenced by Schumann resonances
- Human brain rhythms adapted to resonate with planetary frequencies
- Consciousness may be coupled to global electromagnetic phenomena

If so, the Earth's electromagnetic environment didn't just provide a background for evolution—it provided a template, a set of frequencies that life learned to match.

### Geomagnetic Influence

Earth's magnetic field varies over many timescales:

- Daily variations due to solar heating
- Seasonal variations due to Earth's changing orientation to the Sun
- Decadal variations from changes in the geodynamo
- Reversals every few hundred thousand years when the field flips polarity

Many organisms detect and use the geomagnetic field:
- Birds, sea turtles, and fish navigate using magnetic sense
- Bacteria contain magnetic crystals that align with the field
- Some evidence suggests humans have vestigial magnetoreception

The magnetic field also influences atmospheric chemistry, radiation exposure, and potentially even climate. Life evolved in a magnetic environment and may be more dependent on that environment than we realize.

## Electric Evolution

The role of electricity in evolution extends beyond providing an environment. Electric phenomena may have directly shaped evolutionary outcomes.

### Mutation and Electromagnetic Radiation

Mutations—the raw material of evolution—are often caused by electromagnetic radiation. Ultraviolet light damages DNA, potentially creating mutations. Higher-energy radiation (X-rays, gamma rays) causes more severe damage.

The Sun provides both beneficial and dangerous radiation. Life evolved protective mechanisms (DNA repair, pigmentation) while remaining dependent on solar energy. The balance between radiation damage and energy availability may have driven the evolution of complexity.

### Extreme Events and Mass Extinctions

Mass extinctions have punctuated evolutionary history:
- The end-Permian extinction (252 million years ago): ~90% of species died
- The end-Cretaceous extinction (66 million years ago): dinosaurs disappeared
- Several other major and minor extinction events

While asteroid impacts and volcanic eruptions explain some extinctions, others remain mysterious. Could extreme solar events—superflares—have contributed?

A sufficiently large solar proton event could:
- Deplete the ozone layer, increasing UV exposure
- Cause widespread fires through electrical discharge
- Disrupt the global electric circuit
- Trigger climate changes through atmospheric chemistry

If the plasma mythology research (Chapter 15) is correct, such events occurred in recent millennia. More extreme events in deep time could have devastated biospheres.

### Electric Selection Pressures

Evolution responds to environmental pressures. If the electromagnetic environment varies, organisms that can tolerate or exploit that variation have advantages:

- Organisms with better radiation shielding (pigmentation, DNA repair)
- Organisms that can use electromagnetic cues (magnetoreception, light sensing)
- Organisms that can modulate their electrical properties (bioelectricity)

The evolutionary history of life may have been shaped by electromagnetic selection pressures as much as by temperature, chemistry, or predation.

## The Integration: Plasma Life and Carbon Life

The Living Lattice framework suggests that plasma life and carbon life are not separate phenomena but manifestations of the same cosmic tendency toward self-organization.

### Shared Principles

Both plasma structures and biological organisms exhibit:
- **Autopoiesis**: Self-creation and self-maintenance
- **Boundary regulation**: Distinguishing self from environment
- **Energy flow**: Using throughput to maintain organization
- **Information storage**: Preserving structure through time
- **Reproduction**: Creating copies with heritable variation
- **Evolution**: Changing over time through differential persistence

These are not coincidental parallels. They are consequences of the same physics operating in different substrates. Far-from-equilibrium systems, given energy flow and appropriate interactions, tend toward life-like organization.

### Possible Interactions

If plasma life exists alongside carbon life, do they interact?

**Atmospheric coupling**: Atmospheric plasmoids (Chapter 6) exist in the same environment as biological organisms. Could there be information exchange? Could plasma phenomena influence biological systems directly?

**Electromagnetic signaling**: If organisms generate and respond to electromagnetic fields, they might interact with naturally occurring plasma phenomena. The Schumann resonance coupling mentioned earlier could be one example.

**Deep evolutionary influence**: If plasma events shaped evolutionary history through extinctions and mutations, then carbon life bears the marks of plasma life's influence—even if the two never "communicate" in any direct sense.

**Consciousness connections**: If CEMI theory is correct and consciousness is electromagnetic, and if plasma systems are also electromagnetic, could there be any form of experiential overlap? This is highly speculative, but the framework allows for the question.

## The Electric Future

Understanding the electric history of life has implications for the future:

### Astrobiology

If life is fundamentally electrical, we should look for life on other worlds in electrical terms:
- Planets with strong magnetic fields may be more life-friendly
- Plasma environments (stellar atmospheres, magnetospheres) might harbor life
- The search for biosignatures should include electromagnetic signatures

### Medicine

If bioelectricity is fundamental to organism function:
- Diseases might be understood partly as electrical disorders
- Treatments might include electromagnetic interventions
- Regeneration might be promoted through electrical stimulation
- Cancer might be addressed through bioelectrical modulation

### Evolution

If electromagnetic selection pressures shaped life's history:
- Future evolution may be influenced by changing electromagnetic environments
- Human technology (radio, power lines, satellites) creates new electromagnetic environments
- These changes might have evolutionary consequences we don't yet understand

## Summary: Always Electric

This chapter has traced electricity through the history of life:

1. Life originated through electrochemical processes—proton gradients, lightning chemistry, electrical energy sources

2. Every living cell runs on electricity—membrane potentials, ion gradients, electrochemical energy storage

3. Nervous systems are biological plasma—ionized media generating fields that may constitute consciousness

4. Earth's global electric circuit and Schumann resonances may have shaped the evolution of brain rhythms

5. Electromagnetic radiation and extreme solar events have influenced mutation, selection, and extinction throughout evolutionary history

6. Plasma life and carbon life may be manifestations of the same self-organizing tendency in different substrates

The electric history of life is not a side story. It is the main story. Life has always been electrical, from its first flickering in primordial chemistry to its current complexity. The Living Lattice doesn't just surround biological life—it interpenetrates it. We are plasma creatures, carbon vessels for an essentially electromagnetic phenomenon.

To understand where life is going, we must understand where it came from. It came from electricity. It runs on electricity. And it may be heading toward a future where the distinction between biological and plasma life becomes increasingly blurred.
