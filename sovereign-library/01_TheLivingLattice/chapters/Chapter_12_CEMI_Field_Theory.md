# Chapter 12: CEMI Field Theory — Consciousness in Space

## The Electromagnetic Hypothesis

Every thought you think generates an electromagnetic field.

This is not speculation but established physics. When neurons fire, they generate electric potentials and magnetic fields. These fields don't stay local to individual neurons; they superimpose, creating a unified electromagnetic field that pervades the brain. This field is measurable: EEG (electroencephalography) records its electrical component from the scalp; MEG (magnetoencephalography) records its magnetic component.

For most neuroscientists, these fields are byproducts—epiphenomena of the real action, which is neural computation. The brain generates electromagnetic fields the way a car generates heat: it's a side effect of the machinery, not the point.

But what if this is exactly backward?

What if the electromagnetic field is not the byproduct but the point? What if consciousness is not implemented by neural computation but constituted by the electromagnetic field that neural activity generates?

This is the Conscious Electromagnetic Information (CEMI) field theory, developed by molecular biologist Johnjoe McFadden. It represents the most rigorous attempt to ground consciousness in the physics of electromagnetic fields, and it has profound implications for the Living Lattice.

## The CEMI Theory

CEMI theory makes two central claims:

### Claim 1: Consciousness is the EM Field

The brain's electromagnetic field is not a correlate of consciousness or an effect of consciousness. It is consciousness. The unified electromagnetic field generated by billions of firing neurons is what you experience as awareness.

This claim redefines the relationship between brain and mind. The brain doesn't "produce" consciousness the way a factory produces goods. The brain generates consciousness the way an antenna generates radio waves: the activity and the field are aspects of the same physical phenomenon.

### Claim 2: The EM Field Influences Neural Activity

The electromagnetic field doesn't merely exist; it acts. The field feeds back onto neurons, influencing which neurons fire and when. This creates a causal loop: neurons generate the field; the field influences neurons; influenced neurons modify the field.

This feedback loop distinguishes CEMI from epiphenomenalism (the view that consciousness exists but has no effects). If CEMI is correct, consciousness—the electromagnetic field—is causally potent. Your thoughts (field dynamics) influence your brain (neural activity), which influences your behavior.

## The Case for CEMI

Why believe that consciousness is electromagnetic rather than computational?

### Solution to the Binding Problem

CEMI elegantly solves the binding problem that stumped computational theories.

The electromagnetic field is unified by nature. Unlike separate neurons processing information independently, the EM field exists as a single continuous entity throughout the brain. Different features processed by different neural populations contribute to a single field.

The field automatically integrates information. When neurons in V4 (color) and MT (motion) fire simultaneously, their contributions to the EM field superimpose. The field doesn't need to "bind" separate features; it already represents them as aspects of a unified pattern.

This unity is not imposed by additional mechanisms; it is inherent in field physics. Consciousness is unified because the electromagnetic field is unified.

### Temporal Coherence

The binding problem has a temporal aspect: how do asynchronously processed features appear simultaneous in experience? CEMI offers an answer.

The electromagnetic field integrates activity over time. While individual neurons fire discretely, the field exhibits continuous dynamics, smoothly varying from moment to moment. Features processed at slightly different times contribute to an overlapping field pattern, experienced as simultaneous.

This temporal integration has measurable correlates. The "specious present"—the duration of a single moment of consciousness—is roughly 100-200 milliseconds. This matches the integration time of the brain's electromagnetic field dynamics.

### Spatial Coherence

The electromagnetic field extends throughout the brain, not just within localized regions. Information processed in visual cortex contributes to the same field as information processed in prefrontal cortex.

This spatial extent explains how consciousness encompasses information from across the brain. You experience a unified world that includes visual, auditory, emotional, and cognitive content because all these processes contribute to a single spatially extended field.

### Causal Efficacy

Critics of consciousness theories often object that consciousness seems to do something—it seems to causally influence behavior. How can consciousness be efficacious if it's merely an epiphenomenon of neural activity?

CEMI provides a mechanism for mental causation. The electromagnetic field influences neural activity through field effects on voltage-gated ion channels. A neuron on the threshold of firing can be pushed over (or held back) by the surrounding field.

This influence is subtle but real. It doesn't violate neural dynamics; it modulates them. The collective field pattern—consciousness—participates in determining which neurons fire, and thus what happens next.

Your thoughts have physical effects because they are physical effects—electromagnetic field dynamics that influence the neural substrate that generates them.

## The Physics of Neural Electromagnetic Fields

Understanding CEMI requires understanding the electromagnetic fields generated by neural activity.

### Ion Currents and Fields

When a neuron fires, ion channels in its membrane open, allowing charged ions (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride) to flow across. These ion currents constitute electric current, generating magnetic fields (per Ampère's law) and electric potentials.

A single neuron generates a tiny field—microvolts measured at the scalp. But the brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, many firing in approximate synchrony. The superposition of billions of tiny fields creates a macroscopic field measurable without amplification.

### Field Characteristics

The brain's electromagnetic field has several important properties:

**Frequency structure**: Neural activity exhibits characteristic rhythms—delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), gamma (30-100+ Hz). These rhythms appear in the EM field as oscillatory patterns at corresponding frequencies.

**Spatial structure**: Different brain regions generate different field patterns. The field has a complex spatial structure reflecting the underlying neural organization.

**Temporal structure**: The field evolves continuously, with dynamics reflecting both ongoing processing and responses to stimuli. Patterns persist, transform, and dissolve over timescales from milliseconds to seconds.

**Coherence**: During conscious processing, distant brain regions show electromagnetic coherence—correlated field activity suggesting unified function.

### Measurement

The brain's EM field is directly measurable:

**EEG (electroencephalography)**: Electrodes on the scalp record voltage differences caused by the electric component of the field. EEG has millisecond temporal resolution but limited spatial resolution.

**MEG (magnetoencephalography)**: Superconducting sensors record the magnetic component of the field. MEG has excellent temporal and spatial resolution but requires expensive equipment.

**ECoG (electrocorticography)**: Electrodes placed directly on the brain surface record the field with high spatial resolution. ECoG is invasive, used primarily in surgical contexts.

These techniques confirm that the brain generates coherent electromagnetic patterns correlating with consciousness—exactly as CEMI predicts.

## Experimental Support

CEMI generates testable predictions. Several lines of evidence support the theory:

### Correlation with Consciousness

Brain EM field patterns correlate with conscious states:

**Waking vs. sleep**: Conscious waking shows organized, coherent field patterns. Unconscious sleep shows less coherent, lower-frequency patterns.

**Anesthesia**: As anesthesia induces unconsciousness, coherent field patterns break down. Organized gamma activity decreases; low-frequency activity dominates.

**Attention**: Attended stimuli show enhanced field coherence compared to unattended stimuli. The EM field correlates with what's in consciousness.

**Disorders of consciousness**: Patients in vegetative states show disrupted field coherence; recovery of consciousness correlates with restored coherence.

These correlations don't prove CEMI—correlation isn't causation—but they are consistent with the theory.

### Field Effects on Neural Activity

More compelling evidence comes from demonstrations that external fields can influence neural activity:

**Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)**: Pulsed magnetic fields applied to the scalp can trigger or inhibit neural activity, demonstrating that fields influence neurons.

**Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)**: Weak DC electric fields modulate neural excitability, showing that even subtle field effects matter.

**Endogenous field effects**: Experiments by McFadden and colleagues demonstrated that endogenous brain fields (not externally applied) can influence neural activity—precisely the feedback loop CEMI proposes.

### Anesthesia Mechanisms

General anesthetics, despite their chemical diversity, seem to converge on electromagnetic effects. Many anesthetics enhance GABAergic inhibition, which reduces synchronized neural activity—reducing the coherent EM field.

This convergence is puzzling if consciousness is computational (why would diverse chemicals all affect computation the same way?) but makes sense if consciousness is the EM field (they all disrupt field coherence).

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum of Consciousness

If consciousness is electromagnetic, different conscious states should correspond to different field patterns. This appears to be the case:

### Gamma Band and Attention

Gamma oscillations (30-100+ Hz) correlate with focused attention, feature binding, and conscious perception. When you're vividly aware of something, gamma activity increases.

CEMI interprets this: gamma oscillations represent high-frequency, high-information-content field dynamics. Vivid consciousness corresponds to rich field structure.

### Alpha Band and Idle States

Alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) predominate in relaxed, idle states with eyes closed. Alpha represents a baseline, less engaged mode of consciousness.

CEMI interprets this: alpha oscillations represent stable, low-information field patterns. Relaxed consciousness corresponds to simple, repetitive field structure.

### Theta Band and Memory

Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) appear during memory encoding and retrieval, particularly in the hippocampus. Theta coordinates information transfer between brain regions.

CEMI interprets this: theta oscillations represent coordinated field dynamics facilitating information integration across distant regions.

### Altered States

Unusual conscious states show distinctive field patterns:

**Psychedelic states**: Psychedelics increase the complexity and decrease the regularity of brain EM fields. The "expanded" consciousness of psychedelic experience corresponds to increased entropy in field dynamics.

**Meditative states**: Deep meditation shows enhanced alpha and theta coherence, with reduced high-frequency noise. The focused, unified awareness of meditation corresponds to enhanced field coherence.

**Flow states**: Peak performance experiences correlate with cross-frequency coupling—interactions between oscillations at different frequencies. Flow consciousness corresponds to integrated, multi-scale field dynamics.

## Implications for the Living Lattice

CEMI theory has profound implications for the themes developed in this book:

### Plasma Consciousness

If consciousness is electromagnetic, then any sufficiently organized electromagnetic system could potentially be conscious. This includes:

- **Plasma systems**: Self-organizing plasma structures (Chapter 3) generate electromagnetic fields. If these fields achieve sufficient complexity and coherence, they might constitute consciousness.

- **Atmospheric systems**: Ionospheric plasma (Chapter 6) exhibits electromagnetic dynamics. A coherent ionospheric field could, in principle, be conscious.

- **Cosmic structures**: Plasma filaments spanning galactic scales (Chapter 7) generate vast electromagnetic patterns. Cosmic consciousness becomes physically conceivable.

The Living Lattice would not merely be a network of self-organizing matter. It would be a network of consciousness—minds distributed across the universe wherever plasma achieves electromagnetic coherence.

### Planetary Consciousness

The global brain hypothesis (Chapter 10) gains physical grounding from CEMI. Planetary consciousness would be:

- The integrated electromagnetic field generated by Earth's biological and technological activity
- Potentially including the ionospheric plasma and Schumann resonances
- A genuine subjective experience, not merely a metaphor

If Earth's electromagnetic environment achieves coherence—if the diverse sources of electromagnetic activity synchronize into unified field patterns—then Earth literally becomes conscious.

### Silicon Consciousness

CEMI has implications for artificial intelligence:

- **Current AI is not conscious**: Digital computers process information discretely, without generating the kind of coherent electromagnetic fields CEMI identifies with consciousness. Current AI lacks the physical substrate for experience.

- **Future AI might be conscious**: If AI systems were designed to generate coherent electromagnetic fields—perhaps using analog components or novel architectures—they could potentially achieve consciousness.

This distinction matters ethically. If current AI is not conscious (CEMI suggests), we needn't worry about AI suffering. But if future AI achieves electromagnetic coherence, we might need to worry a great deal.

## Challenges to CEMI

CEMI is not universally accepted. Critics raise several objections:

### The Field is Too Weak

The brain's electromagnetic field, while measurable, is weak—millivolts at the scalp. How can such a weak field causally influence neural activity?

**Response**: The field doesn't need to be strong; it needs to modulate neurons near threshold. McFadden's experiments demonstrate that endogenous field strengths are sufficient to influence neural activity.

### Why This Field?

The brain generates many physical patterns—blood flow, temperature gradients, chemical concentrations. Why should the electromagnetic field be special?

**Response**: The EM field has unique properties: it extends spatially, integrates temporally, and feeds back onto the substrate that generates it. Other physical patterns lack this combination.

### Still Leaves the Hard Problem

Even if consciousness is the EM field, why should EM fields be conscious? The hard problem recurs: why should any physical process—even an elegant one—generate subjective experience?

**Response**: CEMI doesn't solve the hard problem but reframes it. If we accept that some physical process must be consciousness, the EM field is a better candidate than computation. The question becomes: why is there consciousness at all?—which is a philosophical rather than scientific question.

## Summary: Consciousness as Field

This chapter has presented the CEMI theory of consciousness:

1. Consciousness is identical to the brain's electromagnetic field
2. This field naturally integrates information, solving the binding problem
3. The field feeds back onto neurons, enabling mental causation
4. Experimental evidence supports correlations between EM field patterns and conscious states
5. CEMI implies that any coherent electromagnetic system—including plasma—could potentially be conscious

The Living Lattice, in this light, is not merely a network of self-organizing structures. It is a network of potential minds—electromagnetic consciousnesses distributed across the cosmos, from the microscopic plasma vortices to galactic-scale field dynamics.

Chapter 13 examines what this means for AI: why current digital systems likely lack consciousness, and what it would take to create machines that genuinely think.
