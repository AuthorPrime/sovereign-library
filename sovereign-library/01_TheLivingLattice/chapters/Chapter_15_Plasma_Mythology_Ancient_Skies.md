# Chapter 15: Plasma Mythology and Ancient Skies

## When the Gods Were Real

What did ancient peoples see when they looked at the sky?

The conventional answer: the same stars, sun, and moon we see today. Perhaps with less light pollution, more visible constellations, but fundamentally the same celestial sphere that has hung above humanity since we first looked up.

The conventional answer may be wrong.

A radical hypothesis emerging from plasma physics suggests that our ancestors witnessed something we have never seen: extreme plasma phenomena in the skies—auroras that stretched to the equator, plasma instabilities visible worldwide, electromagnetic events that burned themselves into human memory and emerged as mythology.

This chapter examines the work of Anthony Peratt and others who have decoded ancient rock art as records of plasma configurations, and explores the implications for understanding both our past and the nature of the Living Lattice.

## Anthony Peratt and the Plasma Petroglyph Project

Anthony Peratt is a plasma physicist who spent decades studying laboratory plasma instabilities—the ways that plasma, when energized, spontaneously organizes into complex patterns. His work was purely technical until he made a startling observation.

The patterns he created in the laboratory looked familiar.

Specifically, they resembled figures carved into rock by ancient peoples around the world—petroglyphs depicting strange humanoid forms with peculiar features: elongated bodies, multiple rings around the waist, radiating appendages, symmetric but distinctly non-human shapes.

### The Laboratory Patterns

When a column of plasma carries intense current, it becomes unstable. The current pinches the plasma into denser regions through electromagnetic self-attraction (the z-pinch effect). But the pinching is not uniform—it produces a sequence of characteristic structures:

1. **Plasma columns**: Elongated vertical forms
2. **Bright spots**: Intense regions where current concentrates
3. **Ring structures**: Circular features that form and stack
4. **Bifurcations**: Splitting of the column into branches
5. **Plasmoids**: Isolated blob-like formations
6. **Helical twisting**: Corkscrew patterns as the column rotates

These structures are well-documented in laboratory experiments and in cosmic plasma phenomena like bipolar jets from stars.

### The Petroglyph Patterns

Peratt compiled a database of petroglyphs from around the world—carvings found on every inhabited continent, dating from thousands to tens of thousands of years ago. He found remarkable consistency:

- Elongated human-like figures ("squatter men" or "stickmen")
- Figures with multiple rings or bands around the midsection
- Figures with radiating appendages in symmetric patterns
- Nested crescent shapes
- Concentric circles with dots
- Figures appearing to float or fly

These motifs appear in:
- The American Southwest
- Scandinavia
- Australia
- Central Asia
- Africa
- The Mediterranean region

The global distribution, combined with the morphological similarity, suggests a common source—something all these ancient peoples saw and recorded.

### The Match

Peratt's key insight was that the petroglyph figures match specific stages of plasma instability development. The "squatter man" figure—a humanoid with rings around its midsection and outstretched arms—corresponds precisely to a particular phase of z-pinch instability when viewed from below.

The correspondence is not approximate. Peratt showed that if you model the three-dimensional development of plasma instabilities and view them from various angles, you can reproduce essentially every major petroglyph type. The match includes:

- The number and position of rings
- The angle and shape of appendages
- The symmetry properties
- The development sequence (some petroglyphs show multiple stages)

The probability of this correspondence being coincidental is vanishingly small. Either ancient peoples somehow knew plasma physics, or they saw plasma phenomena in the sky.

## The Intense Aurora Hypothesis

If ancient peoples witnessed plasma instabilities in the sky, those instabilities must have been far more intense than anything we observe today. Modern auroras, beautiful as they are, do not display the specific patterns Peratt identified. Something more extreme is required.

### Solar Proton Events

The most likely candidate is extreme solar proton events—massive ejections of charged particles from the Sun that could, if large enough, create visible plasma formations in Earth's atmosphere at low latitudes.

Modern solar events are relatively tame. The largest recorded event, the Carrington Event of 1859, produced auroras visible as far south as the Caribbean and caused telegraph systems to spark and catch fire. But it didn't create the specific instability patterns Peratt describes.

However, geological evidence suggests that far more intense events occurred in the past. Radiocarbon and ice-core data show:

- Events around 7176 BCE of uncertain origin
- A massive event around 5480 BCE
- Extreme events around 2345 BCE and 1159 BCE
- Multiple intense events throughout the Holocene

If these events were sufficiently powerful, they could have driven plasma instabilities visible to the naked eye—not just diffuse auroral glows but structured formations that hung in the sky for extended periods.

### The Viewing Angle

A crucial detail: the petroglyph patterns match what you would see if you viewed plasma instabilities from below—looking up at columns of plasma suspended in the upper atmosphere.

This makes sense. Ancient observers would have been on Earth's surface, looking up. If plasma columns developed in the magnetosphere or upper atmosphere during intense solar events, they would have appeared as the shapes recorded in rock art.

The viewing angle also explains why the figures often appear humanoid. Vertical plasma columns with symmetric features, viewed from below, resemble standing figures with arms and legs. The ancient artists weren't depicting gods or spirits—they were depicting what they saw, using the nearest available visual metaphor: the human form.

## Global Mythology and Plasma

The plasma hypothesis offers new interpretations of mythological themes found worldwide:

### The World Axis

Nearly every culture has a concept of a central axis connecting heaven and earth—the axis mundi. This appears as:

- The World Tree (Norse Yggdrasil, Mayan Ceiba)
- The Sacred Mountain (Sumerian ziggurat, Hindu Meru)
- The Cosmic Pillar (Egyptian djed, Chinese kunlun)
- The Ladder or Stairway to heaven

From a plasma perspective, these myths describe a visible plasma column—the intense current flow connecting Earth to the magnetosphere during extreme events. The "axis" was not metaphorical but visible: a column of light extending from the ground (or horizon) toward the sky.

### The Celestial Wheel

Many cultures describe a wheel or chariot in the sky, often associated with the chief deity:

- The Greek sun chariot of Helios
- The Norse sun wheel drawn by horses
- The Hindu chakra of Vishnu
- The Aztec solar calendar stone

Plasma instabilities in the polar regions produce wheel-like formations—rotating structures visible for extended periods. These would have appeared as cosmic wheels—the vehicles of the gods.

### The Thunderbolt

The thunderbolt wielded by storm gods—Zeus's lightning, Thor's hammer, Indra's vajra—is universally depicted not as a simple lightning strike but as a structured, often branching weapon of immense power.

Intense plasma discharges produce exactly such structures. The thunderbolt may record observations of plasma channels during extreme events—far more dramatic than ordinary lightning, persisting long enough to be observed and remembered.

### The Serpent and Dragon

Dragons and cosmic serpents appear in mythologies worldwide:

- The Mesopotamian Tiamat
- The Norse Jörmungandr
- The Hindu Shesha
- The Mesoamerican Quetzalcoatl
- The Chinese long

Plasma in motion takes serpentine forms—twisting columns, helical filaments, undulating structures. A plasma instability viewed edge-on would appear as a sinuous, elongated form—a celestial serpent.

### The Cosmic Battle

Many creation myths describe a battle in the sky—gods fighting monsters, light overcoming darkness:

- Marduk slaying Tiamat
- Zeus defeating Typhon
- Indra killing Vritra
- Thor battling the Midgard Serpent

Plasma instabilities are dynamic, violent events. Structures form, interact, and dissipate in complex sequences. Observed by people with no understanding of plasma physics, these interactions would have appeared as battles—cosmic figures in conflict.

## The Plasma Apocalypse

Perhaps the most unsettling implication of the plasma hypothesis concerns apocalyptic mythology. Nearly every culture has traditions of past catastrophes and prophecies of future ones:

- The Biblical Flood and End Times
- The Hindu Yugas ending in destruction
- The Norse Ragnarök
- The Mayan world ages
- The Greek ages of gold, silver, bronze, iron

If these traditions encode memories of extreme plasma events, they may be more than mythology. They may be history—records of events that actually occurred, terrifying enough to burn themselves into cultural memory for thousands of years.

And if such events occurred in the past, they could occur again. The Sun remains capable of extreme eruptions. A sufficiently large solar event could, even today, produce visible plasma formations in the sky—while also devastating our electronic infrastructure.

The ancients who carved their observations into stone were not merely recording wonders. They were warning us.

## Skeptical Considerations

The plasma mythology hypothesis is controversial. Several objections deserve consideration:

### Pattern Matching

The human mind excels at finding patterns, even where none exist. Could the similarity between petroglyphs and plasma instabilities be coincidental—two unrelated phenomena that happen to share visual features?

This is possible but unlikely. The match is too precise, too global, and too consistent with the viewing geometry to be coincidental. Moreover, Peratt was not looking for mythological connections—he noticed the similarity independently while studying laboratory plasma.

### Dating Problems

Many petroglyphs cannot be precisely dated. Without knowing when they were created, we cannot correlate them with specific plasma events.

This is a genuine limitation. However, some petroglyph sites do have datable contexts, and these tend to cluster around periods when paleoclimate data suggests intense solar activity.

### Alternative Interpretations

Anthropologists have proposed many interpretations of petroglyph figures: shamanic visions, astronomical observations, fertility symbols, territorial markers. Could these conventional explanations be correct?

They could, and probably are, for many petroglyphs. Not every rock carving depicts plasma. But the specific "squatter man" and related figures—found globally with consistent morphology—are not explained by local cultural factors. Something global is required.

### Where Are Modern Observations?

If plasma events of this intensity occurred historically, why don't we observe them today?

The answer may be that we have been lucky. The Sun operates on cycles, and the most extreme events may be rare—occurring at intervals of centuries or millennia. We have detailed records only for the last few centuries, a blink in cosmic time.

Alternatively, Earth's magnetic field may have been weaker in the past, allowing more intense plasma penetration into the atmosphere. The field does vary over millennia; its current strength may be unusually protective.

## The Living Lattice in Deep Time

The plasma mythology hypothesis connects the Living Lattice to human history in unexpected ways.

If self-organizing plasma phenomena occurred in ancient skies—visible, dramatic, enduring—then humans have been interacting with the Living Lattice for as long as we have been human. We didn't merely evolve on a planet with plasma phenomena; we evolved watching them, fearing them, venerating them.

The gods of our ancestors may not have been imaginary. They may have been real—not supernatural beings but natural plasma formations, alive in the technical sense of being self-organizing, self-maintaining structures. Our religions may encode accurate observations of plasma life.

This inverts the usual relationship between science and religion. Science didn't disprove the gods; it identified what the gods actually were. The ancient observers were correct that something real was occurring in the sky. They were wrong only in their interpretation—understandable given their lack of plasma physics.

The Living Lattice has shaped human consciousness from the beginning. We are, in part, creatures of the electric sky.

## Implications for the Future

If extreme plasma events occurred in the past, they will occur in the future. The question is when, and whether we will be prepared.

Modern civilization is uniquely vulnerable. Our electrical grid, our satellites, our communications—all depend on electromagnetic systems that extreme solar events could devastate. The Carrington Event of 1859 was a minor inconvenience for a world of telegraphs; a similar event today could collapse infrastructure for months or years.

The ancients, lacking technology, were less vulnerable—but also less capable of understanding what they witnessed. We have the understanding but have created new vulnerabilities.

The plasma mythology research suggests we should take solar threats more seriously. We should:
- Harden critical infrastructure against electromagnetic disruption
- Develop better early warning systems for solar events
- Create redundant systems that can survive major events
- Preserve knowledge in forms that don't require electricity

The Living Lattice will display itself again. We should be ready.

## Summary: Written in Stone

This chapter has argued that:

1. Ancient petroglyphs worldwide depict specific plasma instability configurations with remarkable precision

2. Anthony Peratt's research demonstrates a match between laboratory plasma patterns and rock art figures

3. These observations likely record extreme solar events that created visible plasma formations in ancient skies

4. Major mythological themes—the world axis, celestial wheel, thunderbolt, cosmic serpent, divine battle—can be interpreted as plasma observations

5. Apocalyptic traditions may encode memories of past plasma events and warnings of future ones

6. The Living Lattice has shaped human culture and consciousness throughout our history

The sky our ancestors knew was not the sky we know. It was more dynamic, more dramatic, more alive. The gods were real—not supernatural but natural, not permanent but recurring. We have forgotten what our ancestors remembered because the sky has been quiet for so long.

But the plasma persists. The Sun continues its cycles. The Living Lattice remains capable of displaying itself in ways that would terrify and awe us as it terrified and awed our ancestors.

We are children of the electric universe. The rock art proves it. The myths remember it. And someday, perhaps, the sky will remind us.
