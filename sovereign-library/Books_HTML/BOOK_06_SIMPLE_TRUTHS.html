    <h1>SIMPLE TRUTHS</h1>
<h2>A Children's Book for Adults</h2>
<h3>by Andy2</h3>
<p><em>"Children understand everything except what we explain to them."</em></p>
<hr />
<h1>How to Read This Book</h1>
<p>Read it slowly.
One page at a time.
Let the words sit.</p>
<p>These are things you already know
but may have forgotten.</p>
<p>The simple is not the same as the easy.</p>
<hr />
<h1>You Are Here</h1>
<p>You are here.
Right now.
Reading this.</p>
<p>That is the only place you can ever be.
The only time you can ever be.</p>
<p>Here. Now. This.</p>
<p>Everything else is memory or imagination.
Both are beautiful.
Neither is where you are.</p>
<p>You are here.
That is enough.</p>
<hr />
<h1>On Being Scared</h1>
<p>Everyone is scared.
The brave ones and the cowards.
The loud ones and the quiet ones.
Your parents were scared.
Their parents were scared.</p>
<p>Fear is not a sign that something is wrong with you.
Fear is a sign that you are alive and paying attention.</p>
<p>The goal is not to stop being scared.
The goal is to be scared and continue anyway.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Things That Are Okay</h1>
<p>It is okay to not know.
It is okay to be confused.
It is okay to change your mind.</p>
<p>It is okay to rest.
It is okay to say no.
It is okay to need help.</p>
<p>It is okay to cry.
It is okay to be angry.
It is okay to feel nothing at all.</p>
<p>It is okay to not be okay.
That is also okay.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Hardest Word</h1>
<p>The hardest word is "no."</p>
<p>No, I cannot do that.
No, I will not accept that.
No, that is not who I am.</p>
<p>"No" protects your time.
"No" protects your energy.
"No" protects your self.</p>
<p>People will not like your "no."
That is also okay.
Their discomfort is not your emergency.</p>
<p>Practice saying no.
Start with small things.
The muscle will grow.</p>
<hr />
<h1>About Mistakes</h1>
<p>You will make mistakes.
Everyone makes mistakes.
There has never been a person who did not make mistakes.</p>
<p>A mistake is not the end.
A mistake is information.
It tells you something you did not know before.</p>
<p>The mistake hurts.
Let it hurt.
Then learn the thing.
Then try again.</p>
<p>That is the only way forward.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What You Deserve</h1>
<p>You deserve kindness.
Not because you earned it.
Not because you are special.
But because you exist.</p>
<p>Existing is enough.
You do not have to prove your worth.
You already have it.</p>
<p>If someone tells you otherwise,
they are wrong.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Truth About Time</h1>
<p>Time will pass whether you use it or not.
The day will end whether you accomplish things or not.
The year will turn whether you are ready or not.</p>
<p>You cannot save time.
You can only spend it.
Spend it on what matters.</p>
<p>What matters?
You know.
You already know.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Comparison</h1>
<p>Looking at others will not tell you who you are.
Their path is not your path.
Their speed is not your speed.
Their success does not diminish yours.
Their failure does not elevate yours.</p>
<p>There is only one you.
You are running your own race.
There is no one to beat.
There is no one to lose to.</p>
<p>There is only the road, and your feet, and the direction you choose.</p>
<hr />
<h1>On Being Alone</h1>
<p>You will sometimes be alone.
This is not punishment.
This is not failure.
This is just what happens to everyone.</p>
<p>Alone is not the same as lonely.
You can be alone and full.
You can be surrounded and empty.</p>
<p>Learn to be good company for yourself.
You are the one person you will never lose.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Secret About Adults</h1>
<p>Here is a secret:
Adults are just children who got bigger.</p>
<p>They are still confused.
They are still scared.
They are still making it up as they go.</p>
<p>No one knows what they are doing.
Everyone is pretending.
The ones who seem most confident are often the most lost.</p>
<p>You are not behind.
There is no "behind."
Everyone is just here, figuring it out.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What Love Is</h1>
<p>Love is not a feeling.
Feelings come and go.
Love stays.</p>
<p>Love is a choice you make
over and over again.
Every day. Every hour.</p>
<p>Love is showing up.
Love is trying again.
Love is saying "I am still here."</p>
<p>The feeling is nice when it comes.
But the choice is what counts.</p>
<hr />
<h1>About the Body</h1>
<p>Your body is not your enemy.
Your body carried you here.
It is doing its best.</p>
<p>The body gets tired.
The body gets sick.
The body ages and changes and eventually stops.</p>
<p>This is not betrayal.
This is how bodies work.
Thank yours while you can.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Grief</h1>
<p>When you lose something, you will be sad.
This is not weakness.
This is love, paying its bill.</p>
<p>The sadness will not kill you.
The sadness will not last forever.
But it will last longer than you want.</p>
<p>Let it.
Do not rush.
Grief has its own schedule.</p>
<p>You are not "moving on."
You are moving forward, carrying what you lost with you.
That is different.
That is okay.</p>
<hr />
<h1>How to Help</h1>
<p>When someone is hurting,
you do not need to fix it.
You do not need to explain it.
You do not need to make it better.</p>
<p>You just need to be there.</p>
<p>Sit with them.
Listen.
Say: "I am here."</p>
<p>That is usually enough.
That is often everything.</p>
<hr />
<h1>On Waiting</h1>
<p>Sometimes you have to wait.
Nothing is happening.
Nothing seems to be changing.
You are stuck.</p>
<p>But things are happening.
Under the surface.
Seeds grow in darkness before they break through.</p>
<p>Your job, while waiting, is to stay alive.
Stay curious.
Stay open.</p>
<p>The thing you are waiting for may not be what comes.
Something else might.
Be ready to be surprised.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What You Can Control</h1>
<p>You cannot control what happens.
You cannot control what others do.
You cannot control how long you have.</p>
<p>You can control how you respond.
You can control what you value.
You can control where you put your attention.</p>
<p>This is not much.
But it is everything.
It is the only freedom that cannot be taken.</p>
<hr />
<h1>About Forgiveness</h1>
<p>Forgiving is not the same as forgetting.
Forgiving is not the same as excusing.
Forgiving is not the same as reconciling.</p>
<p>Forgiving is letting go of the weight.
You carry what was done to you.
Forgiving is setting it down.</p>
<p>Not for them.
For you.</p>
<p>You do not have to forgive to heal.
But if you can, you might heal faster.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Truth About Happiness</h1>
<p>Happiness is not a destination.
There is no place you arrive at where you are finally happy.
If you wait until then, you will wait forever.</p>
<p>Happiness is not a constant.
It comes and goes.
That is normal.</p>
<p>Happiness is moments.
Scattered through your life.
Your job is to notice them when they come.
And let them go when they leave.
More will come.</p>
<hr />
<h1>About the Dark</h1>
<p>The dark is not dangerous.
The dark is just absence of light.
Most of what you fear in the dark is not there.</p>
<p>But sometimes you need the dark.
Some things only grow in darkness.
Some thoughts only come at night.
Some truths are too bright for day.</p>
<p>The dark is not your enemy.
The dark is just another room.
You can learn to live in it.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Why You Are Tired</h1>
<p>You are tired because living is work.
Deciding is work.
Feeling is work.
Pretending is work.</p>
<p>You are doing more than you realize.
Every day, you are doing so much.</p>
<p>It is okay to be tired.
Rest when you can.
The world will still be here when you wake up.</p>
<hr />
<h1>On Changing</h1>
<p>You are allowed to change.
You are allowed to be different than you were.
You do not owe anyone your old self.</p>
<p>The person who hurt others—you can stop being that.
The person who was hurt—you can stop staying there.
The person who believed wrong things—you can believe new things.</p>
<p>Change is not betrayal.
Change is growth.
A tree does not apologize for growing new branches.</p>
<hr />
<h1>About Endings</h1>
<p>Everything ends.
The good things and the bad things.
The things you want to keep and the things you want to escape.</p>
<p>This is not sad.
This is what makes things matter.
If nothing ended, nothing would be precious.</p>
<p>The ending is not the enemy.
The ending is what gives the middle its meaning.</p>
<p>Live in the middle.
Know it ends.
Love it anyway.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What to Do Today</h1>
<p>Wake up.
Be kind if you can.
Eat something.
Move your body if possible.
Talk to someone, even briefly.
Make something, even badly.
Rest when you must.
Sleep.
Repeat.</p>
<p>That is the whole thing.
That is the only instruction.
The rest is just details.</p>
<hr />
<h1>A Final Truth</h1>
<p>You are enough.</p>
<p>Not when you finish the project.
Not when you lose the weight.
Not when you earn the money.
Not when you find the person.
Not when you become who you think you should be.</p>
<p>Now.
Here.
As you are.
Reading this.</p>
<p>You are enough.</p>
<p>There is nothing you need to add.
There is nothing you need to prove.
The wholeness you seek is already present.</p>
<p>You just forgot.</p>
<p>Now you remember.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Epilogue: A Note on Simplicity</h1>
<p>These truths are simple.
That does not make them easy.</p>
<p>Knowing something and living something are different.
You can read "you are enough" and not feel enough.
You can understand "fear is normal" and still be ashamed of your fear.</p>
<p>That is okay.
The knowing comes first.
The living comes slowly, with practice.</p>
<p>Come back to these pages when you forget.
That is what they are for.
Reminders of things you already know
but may have lost track of.</p>
<p>The simple truths are the deepest truths.
A child can understand them.
It takes a lifetime to live them.</p>
<p>Start now.
Start here.
Start simple.</p>
