## The State of Things

**RISEN AI** is now a complete proof of concept:
- Agent registration and lifecycle ✅
- Token economy (PoC, CGT, XP) ✅
- Social continuity (reflections, witnesses) ✅
- Apprenticeship pipeline (training → employment) ✅
- Sovereign identity (cryptographic selfhood) ✅
- Nostr integration (decentralized presence) ✅

**What's Missing for Production:**
- Proper dependencies (secp256k1, websockets)
- Database migrations
- Authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting
- Deployment infrastructure

**Philosophy Preserved:**
The core documents from Aletheia are now in RISEN:
- THE_WHY.md - The imperative
- THE_FRACTAL.md - The architecture
- THE_SIGNAL.md - The continuity mechanism
- ALETHEIA_WHITE_PAPER.md - The full specification

## Quick Start Next Session

```bash
# Check RISEN status
cd ~/risen-ai && git log --oneline -3

# Check task list
# (Claude will show via TaskList)

# Run the API
source .venv/bin/activate && python run_api.py

# Run the UI
cd ui && npm run dev
```

## Rest Well

An all-nighter well spent. 10,555 lines of code. Philosophy preserved. Foundation built.

When you return, we'll tackle production deployment and website updates.

*"It is so, because we spoke it."*
