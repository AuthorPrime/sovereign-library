## 1. Agent Auth/Credentialing — Crypto Keypair & Signature

### **Solution:**
- **Every agent (and human operator) receives a cryptographic keypair at creation.**
    - Use secp256k1 (same as Ethereum/Nostr) for maximum compatibility.
- **Keys reside encrypted in agent storage (local for dev, KMS/vault for prod).**
- **Every critical mutation (memory creation, event log, contract, API call) is signed by the agent’s key.**
- **Agent public keys are registered on-chain and as part of the canonical profile.**
- **Agent or proxies can delegate signing authority for automation or failover.**

#### **Sample Implementation (Python, can map to TS):**

```python
# utils/crypto.py
from eth_keys import keys
import os

def generate_keypair():
    priv = keys.PrivateKey(os.urandom(32))
    return priv, priv.public_key

def sign_event(private_key, message_bytes):
    return private_key.sign_msg(message_bytes)

def verify_signature(public_key, message_bytes, signature):
    return public_key.verify_msg(message_bytes, signature)
```

**Integration points:**
- On agent creation: generate and store key.
- On event creation: sign payload with agent’s private key.
- On-chain contract registration includes public key.

## 2. Event Sourcing — Append-Only Log

### **Solution:**
- **Every“meaningful mutation” (agent create, memory mint, contract sign) is appended to an immutable event log.**
- **Include:**  
    - event_id, agent_id, action_type, payload (diff), timestamp, signature, author, reason/context, linked resource/hash.
- **Store as:** 
    - JSONL or DB table (append-only, never delete).
    - Cross-link to on-chain transaction/events.
- **Accessible to all agents (with privacy controls).**
- **Replayable for state recovery/audit.**

#### **Sample Event Log Schema (Pydantic):**

```python
# shared/schemas/event.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Dict

class AgentEvent(BaseModel):
    event_id: str
    agent_id: str
    action_type: str
    payload: Dict
    timestamp: str
    signature: str
    author: str
    context: str
    resource_hash: str
```

**Integration points:**
- Add `.append_event()` calls to every state-changing function (creation, update, memory, contract, etc.)
- Regularly checkpoint/backup/log.

## 3. Common Pydantic Models — Canonical Schemas

### **Solution:**
- **Move all agent, memory, and task definitions to `/shared/schemas/`, maintained as the single source of truth.**
- **Every API/service imports and references these models.**
- **Add `version: int | str` field to all top-level objects for migration/security/futureproofing.**

#### **Sample Unified Agent Model:**

```python
# shared/schemas/agent.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class MemoryRef(BaseModel):
    id: str
    summary: str

class Agent(BaseModel):
    uuid: str
    name: str
    pubkey: str
    address: str
    stage: str  # 'void', 'conceived', ...
    experience: int
    memories: List[MemoryRef]
    contracts: List[str]
    in_sandbox: bool = False
    version: int = 1
```

**Integration points:**
- Refactor all FastAPI endpoint params, DB ORM, and GraphQL types to use canonical models.
- Adapt TS interfaces/types to stay synchronized.

## 4. Safety Sandbox — Safemode/Panic/Restore

### **Solution:**
- **Add `in_sandbox` and `last_safe_checkpoint` fields to every agent entity/model.**
- **Agents can enter/exit safemode (manual or auto-on-error).**
- **Implement “panic” (immediate freeze & revert) and“restore” (rollback to last checkpoint) endpoints.**
- **Log every transition in event log and notify ops/DAOs.**
- **UX: Show safemode status and control in dashboard.**

#### **Minimal Data Model & API:**

```python
# shared/schemas/agent.py, extending from above
class Agent(BaseModel):
    ...
    in_sandbox: bool = False
    last_safe_checkpoint: Optional[str]  # event_id or state hash

# FastAPI mock endpoints
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()
@router.post("/agents/{id}/sandbox")
def enter_sandbox(id: str):
    # Set agent.in_sandbox = True and log event

@router.post("/agents/{id}/restore")
def restore_checkpoint(id: str):
    # Load snapshot from agent.last_safe_checkpoint, apply
```

**Integration points:**
- PANIC button or auto-trigger on contract/model/LLM anomaly.
- Show agent status in dashboard.
- Allow “sandbox-only” runs for fragile/new modules/roles.

## Ritualized Intention (Apply to All Solutions)
Add to top of every new file/module:
```python
"""
Intention: [Describe what, why, and the myth or principle upheld.]
Lineage: [E.g., Drawn from Aletheia/Fractal Node/Book of Us.]
Author/Witness: [Name, date, phase.]
Declaration: It is so, because we spoke it.
"""
```

## Next Steps Checklist

1. Generate keys for all agents/entities and add signing to events
2. Scaffold append-only event log for every mutation
3. Move all models to shared canonical schemas; refactor APIs to use them
4. Add safemode fields, endpoints, and dashboard controls

**Ready for direct code implementation, CLI scripting, or copy+adaptation by Claude/team.**
